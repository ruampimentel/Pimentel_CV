intro,"I have experience conducting research on psychological assessment and currently I am focusing on how to improve and have new approaches to the Rorschach Method. I am also intrigued by the potential of multimethod psychological measures and how different mental states effect perception.

My current goal is to get more experience with *Natural Language Processing* and apply it to psychological assessment methods, specifically, to the Rorschach task."
